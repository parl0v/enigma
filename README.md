<p>Enigma - A brief project for a seminar paper in elective computer science.</p>
<p><i>"Our task was to create an application inspired by the Enigma machine and its methods of encryption and decryption. The application allows users to encrypt and decrypt words and sentences by entering the text they want to protect and converting it into an encrypted form, which can later be decrypted back to its original form."</i></p>
